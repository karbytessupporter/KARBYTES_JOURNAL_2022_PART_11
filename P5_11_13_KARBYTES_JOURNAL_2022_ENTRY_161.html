<p>Though I paid for my BART ride from Castro Valley to (east) Dublin, I did not pay for the BART ride I took from (east) Dublin to West Dublin/Pleasanton where I went to Target to purchase a cheap pair of headphones. While at the West Dublin/Pleasanton BART station, I decided to hop on the train headed to (east) Dublin which arrived within 2 minutes of me reaching the train boarding platform (and I saw that the train headed to Castro Valley would not be arriving for approximately 25 minutes). I decided it would be best for me to get this data intensive job over as quickly as possible by going to the Dublin Whole Foods Market to use the store Wi-Fi network to upload the zip file containing the GitHub repository content pertaining to the first directory page of the 2022 Instagram section of this website. Unfortunately, I was caught not paying for my ride and was written up another ticket and forced to spend myself broke such that I have to walk all the way to West Dublin/Pleasanton BART to avoid getting caught evading fare (because that place is not as heavily guarded). I have noticed that it is increasingly hard for me to get around and it seems that I am practically being forced to stay local to Castro Valley or else drive a car. It seems like a full time job just to prevent myself from becoming suicidally depressed and or driven to hurt myself and others. (That last sentence sounds like me saying what I think certain others want me to say more than saying how I really think and feel just to get it over with so that it is no longer an undisclosed thought to be pried out of me using painful interrogation methods). I can tell that I am being treated like a hostage and someone who deserves to be tortured and deprived of what I feel are basic human rights while other humans smugly watch and sadistically gloat. Oh well. Perhaps &#8220;the system&#8221; is getting more difficult for me as I become more advanced as a user (and hacker) of that system. I will just take this as another hardship to learn from (though there is not much to glean other than realizing that I have to fight hard to not be dependent on a privately owned petroleum powered vehicle rather than on green commute methods and public transportation). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I read in an article recently that perhaps the single most effective thing a person can do to mitigate their negative ecological impact is to not drive a petroleum powered car.</span></p>
<p>(By the way, I checked the Alameda Court website to look up information about my upcoming court date in November (and those details are recorded in a page of my tertiary website) and saw no results show up in that search. I also have at least one BART fare evasion ticket I have yet to receive mail about nor see show up in the search results of that court website. Hence, the government does not seem to be very reliable when it comes to keeping citizens informed about their legal status. I also noticed that I missed COVID-19 related stimulus checks and electronic benefits payments and only got one of each while seemingly most other citizens received all of their payments (i.e. at least three different disbursements and not just one). I did not bother filing a complaint because I see that the system is a big, inefficient, and largely ineffective bureaucratic system which pressures seems to implicitly demand that people hardly leave their homes and hardly spend any money. What I just said sounds a bit unobjective and presumptuous, but I thought it would not be a bad idea to flippantly say rather &#8220;absurd&#8221; things on this website once in a while. Otherwise, I am afraid too little information about what I am grappling with will show up on this website and hence be made knowable to other people).</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to express how much I love BART. Sadly, one of my favorite images which was part of my stolen and deleted Instagram account was a picture of a poster in a BART station claiming that using BART to commute every day for a month outputs less pollution than does driving in a petroleum powered vehicle for just one of those commutes. Perhaps I will be able to extract old images as screenshots which are slightly lower resolution than the originals to re-publish to my new Instagram. That&#8217;s what I plan to do tonight. Also, I plan to pay for my BART fare as often as possible even though I will have to cut down on grocery spending to do so. I would rather do that than drive that petroleum powered car which I am keeping stationary and away from my parents so that they do not get accused of allowing me to hide in their homes while I am &#8220;supposed to be&#8221; out working (or taking care of tasks outside the home). One thing I can brag about that seemingly most others cannot is not having to pay for gasoline nor other expenses related to upkeeping that vehicle. I do not own the title to that car and I am not paying insurance on that car. (In the past I suggested that my mom stop paying insurance on the car and maybe even sell it or give it away because I did not want to have to depend on that instead of greener and cheaper commute methods. My mom insisted on continuing to pay approximately $300 per month to keep that vehicle ensured &#8220;just in case&#8221; anyone in her family needed it (and me especially). While I appreciate the generous material support, I would much rather be paid to commute my preferred way. Hence, I feel that &#8220;the real Karlina&#8221; is not nearly as invested in as is the gasoline-guzzling Pig Gorl whipped Karlina. (I do think that Pig Gorl is playing devil&#8217;s advocate deep down and wants me to beat her at this game of ethos and logos over pathos by not giving into the temptation to depend on that gasoline powered vehicle for commuting).</p>

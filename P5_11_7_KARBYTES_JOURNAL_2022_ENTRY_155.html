<p>Last night I spent the night at Horsey Hill. The coyotes were especially vocal. Multiple coyotes were calling and responding to each other. Their voices echoed through the valley and became more distant sounding as they traveled deeper into the wilderness. Two owls were singing together at varying pitches. Underneath the starry sky in the peaceful, serene natural beauty of that part of the world I felt at home. In the morning I woke up to see golden sunlight grace the hills which are covered with dry golden-brown oat straw contrasting beautifully with the lapis lazuli sky. I saw people walking their dogs without leashes. I heard and saw various species of birds. After lying in the grass in the shade of some bush-trees, I walked to my mom&#8217;s house and saw that my mom, grandpa (i.e. my mom&#8217;s dad), and Casey the cat were there. I put my dirty clothes in the washing machine, took a shower, and made a pot of coffee and ate some cereal with blueberries on it. While charging my laptop upstairs in my old bedroom, I checked my personal PayPal account and saw that there was $40 in it. I decided to send it to my Instagram friend in need via Xoom to Gambia and signed up to get text updates sent to my phone about it. Now I feel less guilty about how I use my resources. I am trying to not waste my resources and to help those in need if and when I can for now on.</p>

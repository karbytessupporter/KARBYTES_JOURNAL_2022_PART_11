<p>25_SEPTEMBER_2022: Maybe I should try to get a library card from Dublin&#8217;s public library so that I can use the computers there (to prove that I can work on my website and computer programming assignments at the library as an alternative to having to buy my own privately owned computers). That would put to rest the argument that I have to beg other people to use the Internet. Though the government and employers can deny me employment, I doubt they would deny me the right to use the computers at public libraries to access the Internet. (I tentatively plan to do both: use my personal laptop most of the time and use the public library computers to see deeply I can use the Internet there even at the risk of getting banned from the library)!</p>
<p>Never mind. I would rather be able to install my own software and to do potentially illegal things such as access the darknet. I should apply for another credit card just to prove that even people with shitty credit can get a little extra &#8220;free&#8221; cash once in a while (which is sufficient to get at least one decent laptop for $400 and/or a bicycle for the same price).</p>
<p>I am afraid that the card I order will get intercepted in the mail. I do not have enough money to rent a Post Office Box. I suppose I should just apply for another credit card and faithfully wait for it to arrive in the mail so that I can use it to purchase a bicycle.</p>

<p>Sorry. I am just trying to clear my cache and get to my point. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I see that my student id (ef4645) with California State University East Bay is still active. I used it to login to my student page via the myCSUEB link. That page shows my financial and academic records with that institution. I checked to see that the CSUEB Hayward school library hours are from 8AM to 10PM on most days of the week. Perhaps I will go there tomorrow to see how well I can use the computers there.</span> (Or I can just keep this information relatively fresh in my mind (or at least backed up in my most &#8220;state of the art&#8221; journaling website as ammunition to use in my battle for civil liberties in case I need this backup option to owning my own laptop computer)).</p>

<p>Update (26_SEPTEMBER_2022): <span style="background:#ffff00;">Last time I checked (which was within the past two years), non-students (i.e. the general public) may access the school Wi-Fi at California University East Bay&#8217;s Hayward campus using a guest account and temporary password. All one needs is a smartphone or a computer and an email account.</span></p>

<p>Though it is tempting to only update my primary website and the web page of my secondary website with details about updates to my primary website for the rest of my unemployment period and/or for the rest of the year 2022, I have decided to make a few additional updates to the secondary website (i.e. this website).</p>
<p>Firstly, I got more information about <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_159/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the scam</a> I was recently involved in which caused me to lose access to the Instagram account associated with the username @karbytes while using my new Instagram account (whose username is @karbytes_anew) to message that scammer (@the.adriana.alicia11). While perusing that Instagram account, I saw that the account was created in Nigeria in 2015 and the username has been changed several times and within the past 90 days. What that account seems to be depicting is a cryptocurrency trader. (That account might be a robot-created and robot-managed account or someone who looks nothing like the pictures depicted in that account). See the screenshot image below to see the details in how that &#8220;person&#8221; ignored what I said and told me some rather generic-sounding instruction to use money in my PayPal account to purchase cryptocurrency while acting as an employee of &#8220;her&#8221; company (which I suppose steals people&#8217;s Instagram accounts as a bribe to get those people to pay ransom to get those accounts back and/or to relinquish ownership over those accounts in the hopes of receiving a payout from the cryptocurrency purchase).</p>
<p>Secondly, I applied to several more jobs which were listed on Indeed dot Com. I am not feeling very good about working for Amazon after I read some news today that carbon emissions increased by approximately 40% over the past two years from Amazon in an email petitioning to ask Amazon to hurry up and implement more sustainable infrastructure. Given that Amazon is one of largest companies in the world and has one of the wealthiest chief executive officers in the world (i.e. Jeff Bezos), there seems to be no justifiable excuse for why Amazon is taking so long to modernize its infrastructure to be less harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I almost decided to add more content to my Instagram account to include more personal details but decided that it might be best to wait until after 31_DECEMBER_2022 to add new content. (Last night I backed up the entire GitHub repository which contains all the backed up content (i.e. HTML, images) to my Archive dot Org library (whose contents are publicly available at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://archive.org/details/@karbonbytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://archive.org/details/@karbonbytes</a>)).</p>
<p>Anyway, I am trying to wrap up the entire <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes 2022 Journal section</a> of this website rather early. I do not expect to add any more pages than what are currently published to this website until after 31_DECEMBER_2022. Other than update the last page of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022_part_11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this journal chapter</a> with notes about updates I make to my primary website (and likely adding pages to this journal chapter showcasing screenshots of social media posts I publish to announce updates to the primary website), I do not plan to update this website very much because I am running out of meaningful things to journal about (given my socioeconomic and psychotronic situation) and because I think I need to spend more time studying, getting my personal affairs in order, and not disclosing much more information about myself to the public until I feel that I have something more advanced and worthwhile to present. Reviewing the content which went into this website over the past two years shows me that not very much personal development has occurred (and that scares me because, given how much free time I have had, I have not made very significant advancements as an intellectual even though &#8220;common sense&#8221; suggests I should have made significantly more progress given how relatively easy my life has been compared to those who have less time and fewer educational/recreational opportunities than I have access to). Then again, some people would say that I have advanced faster and to higher heights than many people do. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I personally feel that I have not been as productive and happy (and maybe even rational) as I think I &#8220;should have&#8221; been over the past few years.</span> I was so afraid that I would never transcend this plateau of personal development that I poured most of my time and energy into assembling the websites as they are (i.e. primary: Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, secondary: Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com, tertiary: Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com) in case I die, become incarcerated, or otherwise be prevented from advancing the quality of my creative work (so that I have something to show for my life and a medium through which to communicate my ideas and experiences as widely as possible and with as little censorship as possible). I hope to eventually reach a point in my life (as soon as possible) where my creative output and creative processes are genuinely to my satisfaction and not just me giving myself an &#8220;easy A&#8221; (i.e. a passing grade to say that my content is &#8220;good enough&#8221; because I have seemingly not been able to produce higher quality content during the first few years of these websites&#8217; development). In other words, I hope and expect to improve as a content creator such that I am not lying to myself when I say that I am genuinely pleased with what I have accomplished and not just pretending to be pleased.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Lastly, it was suggested to me that &#8220;Alan&#8221; wants me to stop being such an environmentalist so that I can hurry up and make money doing some job which requires minimal experience and minimal education while &#8220;Spencer&#8221; wants me to keep being an environmentalist and following my intuition to do what feels most congruent with my personal ethics. I do think that &#8220;Spencer&#8221; is the smarter, kinder, and more interesting of the two imaginary persons (who are based on &#8220;real&#8221; people I have intimately known). I think &#8220;Spencer&#8221; and I have more in common than do &#8220;Alan&#8221; and I. Sadly, I think that &#8220;the world&#8221; would rather I settle for assimilating to &#8220;Alan&#8221; instead of to &#8220;Spencer&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">It is important to remember that money is basically imaginary and only exists if a large enough consensus believes that it does. It is important to not let money be treated as limiting as actual physical limitations are. In other words, it is important to not confuse money with energy, matter, time, and space. (I would like to add that my &#8220;new and improved&#8221; goal in life is to be a good stoic (i.e. someone who is good at handling reality rather than falling apart over it) rather than to feel as good as I can. In other words, I am now more of a stoic and less of a hedonist than I used to be (though I would say that my stoicism is a &#8220;mature form of hedonism&#8221;)).</span></p>

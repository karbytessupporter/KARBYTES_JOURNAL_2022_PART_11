<p>While hiking up the long hill to a nice vista of the San Francisco Bay Area (Northern California) from the vantage of San Leandro hills, I appreciated how there were so many commercial airplanes glistening in the air at once. The stars in the sky above and the city lights illuminating the flats of the Bay Area like a fancy computer circuit board enchanted me. Without having to turn my head and while looking towards the bay, I see at least three illuminated airplanes at once; each traversing a relatively straight line going a direction all the other airplanes in that space are not.</p>
<p>The significance of writing this note is that observing human-made aircrafts and spacecrafts such as airplanes and satellites reminds me of what I like about humanity (and how such feats of engineering would likely not be possible if it were not for humans gradually domesticating themselves to become less violent as time passes across multiple generations of humans. Though I have never read the book, Steven Pinker wrote some book titled &#8220;Better Angles of Our Nature&#8221; discussing that historical trend. (I did not bother providing a Wikipedia link to extrapolate on this subject because, quite frankly, I am tired of spending so much of my blog space on anthropocentricism instead of more general understandings of intelligence).</p>
<p>(By the way, some smiling and energetic young guy on a BART train saw me sitting on the Castro Valley BART station platform and gave me a generous bag full of dry food stuffs. Though I did not really want it, I tried to appear grateful. I felt bad about the thought of discarding that bag by leaving it abandoned like a baby. Hence, I carried the bag with me all the way to wear &#8220;my&#8221; car has been sitting idly for over a week. I put the bag in the front seat then closed and locked the door. (When I came to unlock it today, I noticed that the car was unlocked (and I would not be surprised if my parents did that in order to nonverbally insinuate that they are patrolling my whereabouts with that vehicle))).</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is much less of a karmic burden for me to simply walk. Bicycling is still a luxury at this time seemingly no person (except for myself) is willing to help me afford. I see that I face a monumental amount of resistance from people just for not driving a car like &#8220;everyone else does&#8221;. Perhaps my &#8220;real&#8221; job is to get around without a car (especially by walking and by being a good backpacker and solo traveler and camper who knows how to effectively use the resources at my disposal.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(For those who do not know how I use the Internet seemingly whenever I want to, I use my Android phone to establish a mobile Internet connection to my laptop computer using a USB-C cable at a rate of $20 per every 3 gigabytes of mobile data through the mobile phone service provider named AT&amp;T).</span></p>
<p>I have started preferring to almost always wear my white bucket hat (even at night) because it provides me the illusion of being underneath some kind of roof instead of naked beneath the sky which feels like an unblinking eye always watching me. I especially enjoy wearing headphones (and I am starting to strongly prefer the in-ear instead of over-ear because in-ear headphones take up less space and do not seem to get displaced as easily as the more loose-fitting over-ear headphones I would have gotten for approximately the same price).</p>

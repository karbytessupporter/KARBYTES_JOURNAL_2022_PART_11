<p>25_SEPTEMBER_2022: The following is a &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; fantasy of mine&#8230;</p>
<p>If the government could talk to me in a manner of speech which is similar to mine, it might say something like this to me: &#8220;Karlina, you have been classified as a dangerous, disruptive to social order, and mentally unstable person (and there is sufficient legal evidence to support that claim for most people to dismiss you are such). Karlina, because of how you have been classified, you have been deemed to be unfit to use your own brain, to communicate on your own behalf, to own property, to manage money, and to be eligible for employment. You have other people monitoring you at all times and preventing you from utilizing your mental and physiological capacities as freely and as intensely as you would without such interference. Even your websites are being censored such that what other people access when they open links to your website is a website which impersonates what you wrote in a way which makes you appear less intelligent, less humanitarian, less passionate, less creative, and less talented than you really are so that people are not inspired to give &#8216;your content&#8217; a second glance. We do not like how you focus on yourself so much and hardly make specific named persons other than yourself a part of what you write about. We really do not want you to be able to do what you want with your time. We do not want you to have enough money to do more than survive while living in impoverished and degrading conditions. What we want you to do is give up on having your own independent Internet presence and to let us take over all of your projects, business, and affairs so that we can impersonate you however we want you to in order to prevent you from being known and remembered by civilians as anything more than a bum with borderline personality disorder and pathological narcissism which is impossible to cure. We do not want automation to take over most jobs because we do not want people to have 24 hours a day 7 days a week to use their time as they choose to while living on a universal basic income. We are uncomfortable with you spending so much of your time outside instead of inside an opaque building. As long as you are not inside of an opaque building, we consider you to be loitering in public and being a public burden because we think that you should be in a more private setting so that you do not look so unsupported by us. We would be more willing to support you if you spent more time indoors and shared less personal information about yourself on the Internet. (We do appreciate that you are writing us so many web pages which only you and we can see. See how little other people comment about your websites and how little other people donate to you via your websites&#8217; PayPal links? That is because either no one is interested in the real you or else the real you is being hidden by us. Get over yourself. That&#8217;s all we are condoning. We just want you to stop having to be such a big deal on the Internet and start over from scratch by getting to know people in face-to-face settings rather than online. If you don&#8217;t like the situation you are in, you are deemed to be unready to work and will be prevented from doing anything other than being forced to remain homeless until you stop accepting economic support from your parents completely and let the homelessness services dictate your life from now on. Let them provide you with options and look nowhere else. We will not let you look anywhere else. Bye! See you on the other side once you go through all the humiliating, painful, and wasteful hoops we want you to jump through. By the way, most people know that you are our hostage and most people trust that we are doing the right thing by depriving you of what you think is fair treatment. No one wants to help you because everyone thinks we are providing all the help you need. You live in a military dictatorship run by armed government employees. All civilians submit to us unquestioningly or else those civilians are ostracized and punished).&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; fantasy I described, I wrote a <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a> about how I would keep developing my websites and labeling them as <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;open source and public domain&#8221;</a> even if what I wrote in this journal entry was true.</p>
<p>By the way, I just wanted to let my readers know that I am doing fairly well even though I often write as though I am not feeling very good. I am feeling pretty damn good. Even though I am not as smiley, talkative, busy, and visibly elated as I used to be, I am more satisfied with existence (and my life) than ever before because I am starting to get a sense of mastery over my emotions and reasoning. I am starting to feel like a proficient logician and not just a gimmick salesperson. In the past I used to get by merely by promising myself and others with great zeal that the future will provide the answers to our most burning questions and the salve for our most burning wounds. Now I am afraid to make promises and even to set goals. For that reason, I am deleting that damned web page which was going to be used as a tepid, low-data log for tracking Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com updates and, instead, just add more journal web pages showcasing screenshot images of social media posts which showcase such updates to Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. (A copy of that now defunct page is available below this paragraph). One last thing: I would say that the experiences I have been going through since I categorized the journal entries in this chapter from <span style="background:#d97ea7;">[0]</span> (&#8220;mostly warmup quality&#8221;) to <span style="background:#47f52c;">[1]</span> (&#8220;mostly production quality&#8221;) have been perfect for my needs. I seem to learn the fastest and retain the most information while operating inside of a clue-finding mystery-solving game rather than just getting told words. For that reason, I would like to emphasize that what I write (as educational as it might be) is no substitute for personal experience. My personal experience is not a substitute for your personal experience. I would recommend that you create your own <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> website and even go so far as to back up each of your web pages to the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> at Archive dot Org so that you have a secure personal database to house your most cherished information which you can retrieve indefinitely many times from any node of the World Wide Web for an indefinitely long period of time (and ideally for thousands of years if not forever. Perhaps humans in my &#8220;solipsistic&#8221; worldview will be able to extend our civilization and our individual lifespans for an indefinitely long period of time by jumping through wormholes which keep us from losing our cherished structures as a consequence of the heat death of a universe we are stationed inside of. Perhaps we have friends in &#8220;higher places&#8221; engineering such a pathway to immortality by creating new wormholes which connect new and existing and even past universes into one seamless continuity whose constituent arrow of time&#8221; is always moving in the forward direction and never pausing (but maybe slowing down and speeding up at certain segments of that continuum)).</p>
<p>I enjoy being able to output paragraphs like the previous paragraph because those are the ideas I would spend lots of time delving into exploring (introspectively and by doing scientific research and by doing secondary research (i.e. looking at content other people have created about such ideas)) and making artwork about. If people did not have to spend so much time worrying about passing on their genes and educating their children, they might spend more time figuring out for themselves what is personally meaningful as a standalone human rather than as someone who is guaranteed a supportive social network at all times. One thing I pride myself on is working towards and actually becoming proficient at being able to rapidly rebuild my personal identity after I go through hardships and after significant people other than myself betray me or stop being a part of my life. If someone hacked into all of my personal websites and social media websites, for instance, I could use the WayBack Machine at the Internet Archive to look up the web pages which I successfully backed up as the basis for recovering lost digital content and reconstructing my social media and WordPress presence. (Unlike social media websites such as Twitter, Minds, and Instagram and unlike the website writing platform named WordPress, one need not create a user account with Archive dot Org to save any public web page to the WayBack Machine (and once a web page is successfully saves to the WayBack Machine, that saved copy on the WayBack Machine is essentially immune from being deleted because only administrators to that website have such privileges. Likely, such insiders to the Internet Archive are skilled information technology professionals and advocates for civil liberties (especially freedom of speech) who would not flippantly remove any web pages which are saved to the WayBack Machine. Such people work for a non profit organization which many volunteers contribute to. I trust that their intention is not to censor people nor to make a profit by stealing information or by censoring certain types of information)).</p>

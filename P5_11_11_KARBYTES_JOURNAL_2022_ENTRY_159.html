<p>Earlier this morning, I made the mistake of allowing what now appears to be a scam occur. I was told by another Instagram user who was messaging me that, if I passed a brief intelligence test, I would be awarded $1,000 and that all I had to do was change the email address associated with my Instagram account (the one associated with the user name @karbytes) to a specific other email address that is not mine so that the person messaging me could temporarily cease control over my Instagram account and then the money would be deposited into my PayPal account. I &#8220;should have&#8221; known better not to trust such a scheme. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Now that Instagram account seems to have been deleted. Rather than try to get it back, I decided to just take it as a learning experience of a hardship and move onto making a brand new Instagram account.</span></p>
<p>I already have a new Instagram account (and the username associated with that new Instagram account is @karbytes_anew and the email address associated with that new Instagram account is karbytesforlife@protonmail.com). Right now I am on a shopping errand to get some new over-ear headphones. After that, I will add images to my new Instagram account and create a new directory web page in this website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) for that new Instagram account.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(Note also that I changed the Instagram links on each of my three websites (primary : Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, secondary: Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com, and tertiary: Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com) to stop pointing to the (apparently defunct) <strong>@karbytes</strong> Instagram to the new <strong>@karbytes_anew</strong> Instagram account).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I was not able to afford much more than in-ear (rather than over-ear) headphones which work adequately well enough for my purposes (but are still not as good as having over-ear headphones). Right now I am listening to a noise generator application of my Android phone play a nice &#8220;anchor&#8221; auditory stimulus in my head and not audible to anyone without amplification equipment within about a 15 foot radius of my body. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I like it when people do their best to not force other people to listen to their noise.</span></p>
<p>Warning: the following paragraph is a bit hyperbolic and written under pressure (as usual). If I breathe for even a millisecond longer than &#8220;the matrix&#8221; wants me to, I hear car horns honk seemingly in order to prevent me from breathing out and feeling my nervous system calm down so that I can think more clearly&#8230;</p>
<p>(While I was shopping, I noticed a mother and her scrawny young children standing outside the store with a cardboard sign asking for financial assistance. I also saw a pregnant woman, her male partner, and their young kids watching me and commenting on how I am supposed to be used by the government for &#8220;anger management&#8221; experiments which amount to subjecting me to excruciatingly high amounts of antagonism daily while I do my best to maintain a calm, nonchalant demeanor. Meanwhile, I cannot help but feel many people around me are rather helpless looking and waiting on me or some other person besides themselves to fix society&#8217;s problems for them. I like being single and not having kids and not having very major expenses and having a very small carbon footprint because I almost never drive the petroleum powered van anymore. I just left it to rust at the bottom of the hill so that it would not be an issue of contention if left at either one of my parents&#8217; houses. I plan on using the car just to store my bicycle (which I have yet to obtain) and camping gear. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I think I am happier than most people around me are mainly because I have higher aspirations than making friends and family the center of my life. I have more gratifying things to focus on than friends and family</span>).</p>

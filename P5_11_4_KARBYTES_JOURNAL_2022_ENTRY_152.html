<p>I have been told by other people in the past that I am not very good at hiding my emotions. I suppose I have to settle for not being very good at hiding my emotions. I suppose it is impossible for me to hide that I am anxious, angry, and unhappy seemingly most of the time because that seems to be what society wants (and there seem to be plenty of vigilantes ensuring that is the case; people who monitor me closely and stealthily and who are skilled at undermining my efforts to be happy). <span style="background:#00ff00;">As weak as this sounds, I suppose I have no choice but to surrender to being perpetually miserable because I clearly am outnumbered by people who are more socially connected than I am and have more economic power than I have. Because of such people, I will likely remain destitute and functionally homeless for the rest of my life. I think it is best to give up on expecting the world to become more like how I want it to be as time progresses because there is no guarantee that the world will become more like how I want it to be. I think I should pretend that the way Planet Earth and the human civilization it contains will not get significantly more enjoyable for me than this. In fact, I think I should imagine that my future is going to become progressively bleaker and more excruciating for me.</span> That means I might as well give up on doing much more than the bare minimum to get by and consider most forms of reaching out to others a waste of time (because most persons only care about themselves even while doing a convincing job of appearing to care for others). I decided to cut the crap and not make any pretenses about being a particularly altruistic person. In fact, part of my &#8220;name brand&#8221; is displaying how unabashedly self-centered and stingy with my resources I am so that other people do not get the wrong idea and think that I am some kind of wannabe saint who is here to clothe the naked, feed the hungry, and educate the illiterate.</p>
<p>In the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous journal entry</a> I published, I flippantly used the word &#8220;chauvinist&#8221;. It has been suggested to me that I simply feel unhappy about being a female human instead of a male human. I am actually happy to be housed in the exact human body I am even though it is a female human body. I think I am a lot freer than most women are because of the time and place I was born and raised. Compared to many people, I have a lot of civil liberties by law and access to some of the best geographic, economic, and intellectual opportunities in human history because I live in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California at the advent of the Age of Information. This might be as good as human civilization ever gets before it regresses into third world country conditions due to war, economic imbalances, overpopulation, and environmental destruction. I am happy to have a female genome because I think that I am more genetically advantaged than I would be if I had a human male genotype to survive diseases and to live a long time. I also have the advantage of being able to access transgendered hormone treatment to induce male secondary sexual phenotypal characteristics which I strongly believe have and will continue to enhance my sense of power, ease of mobility, bodily autonomy, and intellectual independence. I am grateful that I have as much control over my body as I currently do. I have little else which I can control with very much precision other than my websites.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am going to try to quickly move on from the adversity I have dealt with in the recent and distant past. Future journal entries are likely going to be much more boring and focused on computer science and popular science news than the melodrama which has taken up most of the web pages which are part of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes 2022 Journal section</a> of this website (i.e. the website named <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>).</p>
<p>Goodbye for now.</p>

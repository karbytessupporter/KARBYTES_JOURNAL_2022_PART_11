<p>After getting some food at Whole Foods Market in Dublin, California, I walked over to a small patch of shade in the middle of a field where buildings are tentatively scheduled to be constructed. A majestic-looking <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dragonfly</a> landed on a branch sticking our of the leafless and apparently dead bush next to me. A few times, I saw the dragonfly turn its head to look in my direction for a few seconds before turning its head back to looking straight in front of it. A few times the dragonfly launched itself off that branch to hover and fly in a small circle through the air for about ten seconds before landing back on that same branch. I think the dragonfly is trying to conserve its energy and perhaps is interested in observing the human next to it (i.e. the animal which is pressing labeled keyboard buttons which each represent a unique symbol into a laptop computer where a corresponding sequence of symbols is being constructed to compose this note (i.e. text which appears on the web page where this literal sequence of text characters is being displayed).</p>
<p>I was thinking about how the dragonfly might be a human-created robot drone which is being used to surveil the four-dimensional space-time continuum it is sent to fly inside of. I do think it is possible that the human military has already engineered robots which are indistinguishable from the animals they were designed to imitate (to the extent that the material comprising those robots is identical to the materials used in non-human engineered animals. If that were the case, there would be no distinction between organic animals and artificially intelligent organic robots. Even the word &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; would start to seem nonsensical. Rather than use the term &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; I would use &#8220;emergent intelligence&#8221;. Well even that term seems nonsensical for the same reason. A molecule of DNA is supposedly less intelligent than is the DNA strand which that molecule is a part of. Likewise, a cell within a multicellular organism is supposedly less intelligent than is the entire multicellular organism which that cell is a part of. Intelligence seems to be the flow of information (and information seems to be the fundamental building block of physical objects). What are abstract objects if not pure nothingness? Pure nothingness has no features but it can be symbolically represented by some physical objects such as the symbol 0 and perhaps some images, words, sounds, and other finite patterns of energy and matter which are associated with the comparatively abstract concept of pure nothingness within the physical information processing circuits of information processing machines. (It could be that information is being transmitted and filtered in ways which do not require the manipulation of matter and energy and that &#8220;non deterministic intervention&#8221; might not be easy to notice by humans because humans tend to be conditioned to think of the world as being a deterministic clock-like machine where every part is controlled by every other part in measurable (empirical) and arithmetically (logical) consistent ways.</p>

<p>I was thinking about how each animal on Planet Earth could each be a unique information processing node of a transpecies <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet of Things</a>. If that were the case, then each animal on Planet Earth is client and/or a server of a relatively abstract (logical) World Wide Web whose relatively physical infrastructure is chemical, electrical, gravitational, electromagnetic, spatial, and temporal attributes which instantiate each animal on Planet Earth (and perhaps the entire physical universe in which that planet is instantiated).</p>

<p>I was thinking about how each node of the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biosphere</a> Internet of Things is either a client or else a server of information which can be represented in a verbatim communicable format (digital) or else approximately communicable format (analog) such that abstract patterns of the &#8220;collective subconscious&#8221; are transmitted between nodes of that biosphere in ways which humans may or else may not be consciously aware of. I was thinking about a factoid I read in a book about the evolution of brains which claimed that only about 10% of human vision is the product of optical nerve activity while the other 90% is from the visualization part of the brain. That means that information is more than just the sequences of ones and zeros which are transmitted from node to node. Information is also the unique web of logical associations between finite pieces of digital information occurring in one finite localized region of the Internet (or, more abstractly, information processing space) and, also, the sum of each unique web of logical associations between finite pieces of digital information occurring in one finite localized region of the Internet (or, more abstractly, information processing space). In order for reality to not appear static, a frame of reference must either take the position of witnessing only pure nothingness or else take the position of witnessing all phenomena which ever occurred within any space-time continuum (however brief and irregardless of how many times that particular space-time continuum is observed by an information processing agent).</p>

<p>For all I know, the dragonfly might just be a visual hallucination being implanted into my mind through the process of stimulating specific circuits of my brain to generate the illusion of there being a dragonfly. The dragonfly might also be more than just an identified pattern in my visual processing throughput. The human I am might also be experienced as some kind of novel pattern in the dragonfly&#8217;s visual processing throughput. If the dragonfly has a mental image of me in its working memory while I have a mental image of the dragonfly in my working memory, the dragonfly and I are <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interoperably</a> co-generating a shared multiplayer simulation to inhabit and interact with each other inside of.</p>
